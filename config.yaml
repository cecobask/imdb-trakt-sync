SYNC:
  # Sync mode to be used when running the application
  # The value must be one of the following:
  #   full     - sync all IMDb items by adding, deleting and updating Trakt resources
  #   add-only - sync only newly added IMDb items to Trakt
  #   dry-run  - identify what IMDb items would be added, deleted or updated on Trakt
  MODE: full
  # Whether to skip history sync or not. If set to true, history sync will be skipped
  # IMDb doesn't offer functionality similar to Trakt history, hence why there can't be a direct mapping between them
  # The syncer will assume you have watched an item if you've submitted a rating for it
  # If the above is satisfied and your history for this item is empty, then a new history entry will be added...
  SKIPHISTORY: true
