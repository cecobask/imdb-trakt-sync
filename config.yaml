SYNC:
    # Sync mode to be used when running the application
    # The value must be one of the following:
    #   full     - sync all IMDb items by adding, deleting and updating Trakt resources
    #   add-only - sync only newly added IMDb items to Trakt
    #   dry-run  - identify what IMDb items would be added, deleted or updated on Trakt
    MODE: full
    # Whether to skip history sync or not. If set to true, history sync will be skipped
    # IMDb doesn't offer functionality similar to Trakt history, hence why there can't be a direct mapping between them
    # The syncer will assume you have watched an item if you've submitted a rating for it
    # If the above is satisfied and your history for this item is empty, then a new history entry will be added...
    SKIPHISTORY: true
    # Maximum duration time to run the syncer
